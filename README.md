## User Experience (UX)

## User Stories - 
- #### story 1
    1. I want to be able to consume the information taught in a visual, fun and engaging manor.
    1. I want any quiz writing to be minimal.
    1. I want to be able to select the answers myself.
    1. I want a visual reward to work towards to keep me engaged. 
    
    
- #### Story 2.
    1. I am easily distracted, anything with too many words or instructions in it and i loose interest. 
    1. Anything that is hard to navigate will mean i loose interest, navigating the quiz must be intuitive. 
    1. I like to learn alone and so i must be able to select the answers myself. 
    1. I need education to be fun and engaging to maintain my concentration. 
    1. I struggle to sit with a book so something interactive is better suited to my learning style. 
   

- #### Story 3
    1. I am fascinated by the topic of the solar system and love learning new facts about it. 
    1. I am enjoy learning independently so would like a simple quiz i could navigate on my own.
    1. I love to be tested and want to achieve a high score so it is important that i know my score and am rewarded for my hard work. 
    
### User Stories - Business Owner
- #### Business story 1
    1. I need the product to be fun and engaging to encourage repeat plays and encourage users to want more i.e. progress to the next level of learning. 
    2. I need the product to be simple enough for children of age 6-12 to utilise it. 
    3. I need it to be optimised for tablet screens as this is how it will mainly be tested.
